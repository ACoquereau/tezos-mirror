Zeronet
=======

Zeronet is the most cutting-edge development network of Tezos. It is
restarted without notice, possibly several times a day.

If you wish to experiment with Tezos we recommend you to test
:ref:`Alphanet<alphanet>`, which is a more stable test network. We
offer no support about the zeronet.

To get free zeronet coins, read :ref:`this page <faucet>`.
