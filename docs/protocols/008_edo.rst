Protocol 008_<TODO> Edo
=======================

This page contains all the relevant information for protocol 008 Edo.
Each of the main changes is briefly described with links to relevant
external documentation and merge requests.
There are dedicated sections for all the changes to RPCs and
operations.
The changelog section contains all the Merge Requests and instructions
to regenerate the protocol sources from the Gitlab branch.

Test network Edonet is available to test Edo.
See details in :ref:`Test Networks<test-networks>`
and instructions to join in :ref:`How to get Tezos<howtoget>`.

The code can be found in the Gitlab branch `proto-008`_ and its full
hash is ``<TODO>``.

.. contents:: Summary of changes

Environment V1
--------------

Edo is the first protocol that relies on a new environment V1 which
introduces the new cryptographic libraries that Edo relies on for its
features. Because of this, in case of a positive vote, all nodes will
have to be updated to a shell containing V1 in order to run Edo.

- update to OCaml 4.09 standard library
- update of all libraries, Tezos specific or not (e.g. Lwt)
- addition of Keccak and SHA3
- addition of BLS12-381
- addition of PVSS
- addition of lib_sapling

RPCs
----

As usual refer to the :ref:`RPC documentation page<rpc>` or the
:ref:`OpenAPI specification page<openapi_specification>` which are
automatically generated with each protocol.

Voting
~~~~~~

- addition of ``votes/current_period``
- addition of ``votes/successor_period``
- deprecation of ``votes/current_period_kind`` in favor of ``votes/current_period``

Metadata
~~~~~~~~

``<block>/metadata`` reflects the changes described later for the
encoding block_metadata_.
It is advised to stop relying on deprecated fields and use the new ones.

Baking right
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- reduce default max_priority to 8 when querying for whole cycles
- more efficient when asking for a restricted set of delegates

Michelson
~~~~~~~~~

- added mandatory balance field to run_code
- added optional legacy switch to typecheck


Encodings
---------

Two encodings change in 008, some fields were deprecated and some added
in their place.
If your software relies on the deprecated fields it should remain
compatible with 008, however it is strongly suggested to use the new
ones as the deprecated will be removed in a future protocol.
If your software parses the encodings then it is not compatible with
008 because of the new added fields.

You can always use the binary ``tezos-codec`` for more details on each
encoding, binary or json.

``block_metadata``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _block_metadata:

The following fields are deprecated

- ``metadata.level``
- ``metadata.voting_period_kind``

in favor of

- ``metadata.level_info``
- ``metadata.voting_period_info``

``operation_receipt``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- new field ``lazy_storage_diff`` in operation receipt
- ``big_map_diff`` is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version


Voting procedure
----------------

- Addition of 5th period called "Adoption", at the end of which it is
  already established that the voted proposal will be activated. This
  period requires no action and serves purely as buffer time for users
  to update their infrastructure to the new protocol.
- Reduction of a period length from 8 cycles to 5 cycles.
  The total duration of the voting procedure goes from 32 cycles (~3
  months) to 25 cycles (~2 months and 10 days).
- Reduction of the duration of the testchain to 5 cycles to match the
  new duration of voting periods.
- The function freeze_listings, which updates the voting weight of
  each delegate, is now called also at the end of the testing period.

Smart contracts/Michelson
-------------------------

Sapling
~~~~~~~
Integration of the Sapling protocol into the Michelson language.
More information can be found in the documentation.

TODO link to sapling doc

Bls12-381
~~~~~~~~~

Addition of Michelson opcodes for the pairing friendly elliptic curve BLS12-381.

TODO link to michelson doc

Tickets
~~~~~~~

- Type ``ticket 'a``
- Instructions ``TICKET``, ``READ_TICKET``, ``SPLIT_TICKET``, ``JOIN_TICKETS``
- Instruction ``GET_AND_UPDATE``

TODO link to ticket doc

Comb pairs
~~~~~~~~~~

- New instructions ``PAIR n``, ``UNPAIR n``, ``GET 2*k+b``, ``UPDATE 2*k+b``
  to respectively build a comb pair of size ``n`` from ``n`` stack
  elements, decompose a comb pair of size ``n`` into ``n`` stack elements,
  access the ``k`` -th element in a comb pair, replace the ``k`` -th element
  in a comb pair
- Optimized notations for comb pair types and values

Type system
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Empty type ``never`` and instruction ``NEVER``
- Types ``chain_id``, ``key``, ``pair``s, ``option``s, ``or``s,
  ``signature``, ``unit`` made comparable
- ``FAILWITH`` restricted to packable types

Macros promoted as instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``UNPAIR``
- n-ary version of ``DUP``

New instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TODO?

Minor
~~~~~

- New hash functions: instructions ``KECCAK`` and ``SHA3``
- Instruction ``LEVEL`` to query the level of the current block
- Instructions ``VOTING_POWER`` (and resp. ``TOTAL_VOTING_POWER``) to
  query the voting power of a particular delegate (resp. of all
  delegates)
- Instruction ``SELF_ADDRESS`` equivalent to ``SELF; ADDRESS`` but allowed in lambdas
- Removed legacy instructions ``STEPS_TO_QUOTA``, ``CREATE_ACCOUNT``,
  and the legacy version of ``CREATE_CONTACT``


Internal
--------

The following changes are not visible to the users but reflect
improvements of the codebase or preparation for future features not
yet completed.

- PVSS in environment V1
- be friendly with ``coq-of-ocaml``
- unification of big maps and sapling states as *lazy storage*
- representation for bigmaps with id and diff (for trace mode)
- tests
- be friendly with ``bisect_ppx``
- comments
- refactorings
- dead code removal

Instructions to reproduce the source tarball
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Development of 008 is frozen in the branch `proto-008`_.
The sources are contained in the directory
``src/proto_alpha/lib_protocol``, which is a rolling home for protocol
development.
This directory is snapshotted each time a new proposal is prepared
using the following instructions::

  $ ./scripts/snapshot_alpha.sh edo_008
  $ ls src/proto_008_*
